# SERVER ERROR (AUTHENTICATION BECOME GLOBAL)

    solution, because the server already have ssl and cloudflare already set ssl/tls to full
    soo when to access API, NEED TO BE HTTPS other wise the error will appear.

# SERVER ERROR (GENRES DON'T HAVE RELATION)

    solution, we are using wrong database, soo just switch it
